This is the toolset I created to help generate the TerrariaHB code. I use ant so that I can chain commands together without writing too much crap to do it.

Commands:
ant wiki - This will run the wiki script which will parse wiki data for items and monsters (only does certain blocks)
ant output - This will run the output script which uses the template to generate the indexFile
ant build - This will run the output script than optimize the png files
