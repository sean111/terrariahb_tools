The Old Man in front of the dungeon.<br>

The Old Man is an NPC found outside every dungeon. He guards the entrance and a dungeon cannot be fully explored until he is gone. When spoken to at day, He will say "Come back at night if you wish to enter". When spoken to at night, he will turn into the Skeletron boss.<br>

When entering the dungeon without fighting him during the night, a group of Skeletron Heads will spawn and attack the player.<br>

When going into a dungeon without fighting him during the day, a single Skeletron Head will spawn and hit the player for 9999 damage. This makes it impossible to continue in the dungeon during daytime. Tunneling into the dungeon from underground will work as long as the player takes caution to remove the back wall as they go.<br>

The Old Man can only be hurt with lava. He will only take 1 damage per second from the lava. Killing the old man is pointless, because his death does not eliminate the Skeletron Heads that will appear inside the dungeon and you will not be able to fight him until the next night when he respawns.<br>

After beating him he is freed of his curse and turns into the Clothier. <br>
