The Guide is the first NPC that you encounter. His tips are mainly for new players to learn the basics of the game. He, unlike other NPCs, does not need a house to stay in, but will move into the first one you build, and will teleport there if he can't get there otherwise.

As of 1.0.5 the guide tells you what you can craft with an item by showing it to him. The player may also kill the guide if equipped with a Guide Voodoo Doll. He will respawn.

Beyond providing tidbits of valuable information and crafting recipes for new players, he has no other purpose and is thus considered a nuisance by many players. As of the 1.0.3 update, hostile NPCs can kill the guide, but he WILL re-spawn.

Although the guide may be annoying, placing a house fit for an NPC far enough from your intended home is often a good strategy to get him out of the way.
