The Arms Dealer is an NPC vendor that will spawn once the following criteria have been met:<br>
    There is an empty house.<br>
    You have acquired a gun (the gun must be in your inventory, not just stored in a chest somewhere).<br>
    It works with ammunition like Musket Ball too, if you have it in your inventory. <br>

The easiest gun to acquire for this purpose is the Musket, which can be obtained by destroying a Shadow Orb.
