The Nurse is an NPC that will spawn once the following criteria have been met:<br>
    There is an empty house.<br>
    You have more than 100 maximum health (use Life Crystals to increase your maximum health). <br>
The Nurse will heal your wounds, for a small price. Healing costs can range from a few copper to a few silver, depending on how much damage you've taken. It costs 1 copper per hitpoint that will be restored (e.g. 100 copper for 100 hitpoints).
