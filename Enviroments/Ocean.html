<p>The Ocean is an area found on the surface of each map. It buffers the very ends of the map.

It is simply a barren body of water which gets very deep before hitting the invisible wall at the edge of the map. If players without proper accessories try to swim to the side of the map, there is a serious risk of drowning. It is recommended to bring a Breathing Reed, a Magic Mirror and/or Flippers, but not quite necessary. At the very least have a Grappling Hook and a few Healing Potions.

Oceans will commonly contain chests with loot pertaining to water.</p>
